## Zoho SMTP 2FA
If you want to send emails with your laravel application using the Zoho mail SMTP follow the steps. If your mailadress has 2FA activated you'll need to go to your zoho settings by going to [Zoho settings](https://accounts.zoho.eu). You'll need to create a ***Application-Specific Password***. You can't use your regular password because logging in will fail [see offical zoho page](https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/adminconsole/two-factor-authentication.html#alink5) and [zoho smtp](https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/pop-access.html?zredirect=f&zsrc=langdropdown&lb=nl).

After you have setup your *Application-Specific Password* you are able to use it in your .env file. 

***.env example***
```.env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.zoho.eu
MAIL_PORT=465
MAIL_USERNAME=yourmail@provider.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_application_specific_password_here
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=ssl
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=yourmail@provider.com
```

# Testing

```php
$this->withoutExceptionHandling()
```

use App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken;

$this->withoutMiddleware(VerifyCsrfToken::class);
```

or alter the file VerifyCsrfToken.php and alter the $except array
```php
 protected $except = [
        '*'
    ];
```

# Trouble shooting

### Uploaded files/images to the storage folder are not accessable and return a 404 when viewed in the browser.

##### Solution 1 
This specific stackoverflow issue helped me solve the described problem:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50730143/laravel-storage-link-wont-work-on-production

Try to delete storage folder
run:
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

If that didn't do the trick try to also delete other folder you want to be acceccable through a symlink.
And your issue should be solved. 

# Filament (v2)
Here are some interesting tips on Filament 2.

## Resource view
If you are creating a [View Page](https://filamentphp.com/docs/2.x/admin/resources#view-page) for your resource here are some pointer to help you out.

### Accessing record data from your View page
You can access you data from within you views with `$record`. This will return the current Model you are viewing. You have also the `$data` variable available which has some more data about the current resource you are viewing.

#### Example
***laravel-app/resources/views/filament/resources/announcement-resource/pages/view-announcement.blade.php***
```blade
<x-filament::page>
 <h1>Announcement date {{ $record->created_at }}</h1>
 <p>Description {{ $record->description }}</h1>
</x-filament::page>

```

### Displaying resource table in view-only mode on View page
If you want to display the table of your resource in *View only* mode you can simply access the `$this->form` property from your blade file.

#### Example

```blade
<x-filament::page>
    <div class="p-6 space-y-4 bg-white rounded-xl border border-gray-300 filament-forms-card-component">
        <div>
            <h1 class="font-bold text-lg">Submitted by</h1>
             <p class="mt-2">{{ $record->guest->name }}</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Department â€¢ <strong>{{ $record->department->name }}</strong></p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- You form will be rendere here -->
    {{ $this->form }}
</x-filament::page>

```
